# GRADS

# Setup the build path
We used the following jars with our package:
gson-2.4.jar
hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
junit-4.12.jar
Theses jars are located in GRADS/workspace/GRADS/lib
Make sure these jars are on your build path for our program to work correctly.

# How to test our code
We have setup a JUnit test class called GRADSIntfTest
which is located at GRADS/workspace/GRADS/src/edu/sc/csce740/test

This test class uses oracles we created to assist in testing from 
GRADS/workspace/GRADS/src/resources
